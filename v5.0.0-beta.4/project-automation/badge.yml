# This job will create or update a badge when extended using the following template.
# It requires a Project Access Token or Personal Access Token with api scope set
# as a CI/CD variable called GL_TOKEN.
# To create your own automatic badges, add the following to your .gitlab-ci.yml:

# badge:your_custom_job:
#   extends: .badge
#   variables:
#     LABEL: "version"
#     VALUE: "1.2.3"
#     COLOR: "red"
#     URL: "${CI_PROJECT_URL}/tags/${CI_COMMIT_TAG}"
#     BADGE_NAME: ""  # Optional. Name of the badge in Settings. Defaults to $LABEL

# Make sure your_custom_job is replaced and unique, and you've changed the variables
# according to your preferences.

# Choose a color from this list: https://github.com/jongracecox/anybadge#colors

# Make sure your rules at least include the requirement of $GL_TOKEN
