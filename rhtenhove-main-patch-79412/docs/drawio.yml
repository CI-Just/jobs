# You can access the resulting images by adding the
# following to a README.md:
# ![description](/../-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/filename.png?job=docs%3Adrawio)
# Replace filename with the name of the .drawio file, and the extension
# if you changed the FORMAT variable.
# The ref (currently master) is hardcoded, so the README.md render will only
# show what is built on that ref.

# You can have multiple files (even in subdirectories), and the README.md
# can be in any directory. Just make sure the path is correct. For example:
# `dir/subdir/dia.drawio is shown using ![description](/../-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/dir/subdir/dia.png?job=docs%3Adrawio)
